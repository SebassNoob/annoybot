- /fakemute and /fakeban timeout duration 2s->1s and cooldown 7->2 per 30 seconds

backend:

fixes:
- you no longer can unban yourself with /serversettings blacklist remove (even if you're a mod)
- bot no longer stays afk in voice channel after being forcefully moved.

known issues:
- forced removal of the bot from a voice channel will trigger a forced reconnect, rendering the but unable to update its voice state. Fixed in the next version of discord.py
