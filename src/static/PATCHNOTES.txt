PATCH 2.0.0

optimisation:

- /settings color now contains a link to a wikipedia article on what is a hex color
- /removedata is now /settings removedata
- /earrape is now limited to 10s, and now attempts to play at 2x volume. 
- /channeltroll user response window has been increased 10s->20s

backend:
- DB has been restructured and is now hosted on Turso.
- introduced Redis as a cache to store user data


fixes:
- you no longer can unban yourself with /serversettings blacklist remove (even if you're a mod)
- bot no longer stays afk in voice channel after being forcefully moved.
- added check to ensure voice channel is not full before bot joins a voice channel.

known issues:
- forced removal of the bot from a voice channel will trigger a forced reconnect, rendering the but unable to update its voice state. Fixed in the next version of discord.py
